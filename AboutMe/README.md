## I am a game programmer:

I love games, just like everyone else, but my brain is the kind that never seems to get enough stimulation and simply playing them is not enough.
The biggest reason I got into game development is because of my undying tendencies to get hooked on mechanics that don't work the way I want,
and I simply don't want to wait for the developers to listen to my *obviously great* suggestions.

I guess my favorite movie quote would be:
"*Fine. I'll Do it Myself.*"


So far this mindset is working pretty great for me, it's a lot easier to work with systems that you've rebuilt and understand just as good as your own mind.
Though true understanding of something never comes until you try to explain your findings to someone else and realizing there was a better way of doing it all along.

The problems I love tackling the most are location/position, movement based or otherwhise vector or rotation based. I have a few examples of such problems linked in other subfolders of this repo.

For some reason I'm also kind of a big fan of refactoring and optimization, I guess that translates to me being somewhat of a perfectionist, but I prefer to call it "not setteling for mediocracy".
As you might've guessed by now, my biggest strength is my stubborness.



My sworn enemies are *q*u*a*t*e*r*n*i*o*n*s* and maTrIxEs (**I shall not rest until they're conquered**) and my partners in crime are **3vectors** and **adaptive music**.

## I am a few other things too I guess

Long before I became a programmer, for what I suppose would be half my life at this point, I've been a musician.
I've played saxophone in several different bands, mostly playing jazz on either alt. or baritone. As of writing this I'm currently playing in Uffe Big Band in Bor√•s.

Since I spent a lot of time learning all sorts of music theory, I feel kind of obligated to incorporate that in game development.
Luckily, It's super fun and rewarding to implement adaptive music. 
I think it's such an underrated and sometimes even defining trait when it comes to perfecting the game feel, and so I often find myself kind of "*virtually singing along in my head*" during game testing.
*I'm not insane I promise*

It's not uncommon for me to wear both the programmer and the music hat, especially if the team is missing a musician or audio designer.
One of my biggest flexes are winning LBS Game Awards 2021 "Best Music" when competing against teams with designated musicians.

I should probably mention that I've done military service aswell so there's not alot of things that could get thrown at me that would make me break down.
My stress management and humbleness tend to be rather high.
