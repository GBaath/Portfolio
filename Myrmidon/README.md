# *Myrmidon: Phantom Protocol*
 ## Description
 This page contains work I have contributed to Myrmidon for an Unreal 5 startup.
Myrmidon is a top-down, isometric, real-time tactics stealth game set in a brutalist cyberpunk future. 
The player takes control of up to 5 characters with different abilities and strengths to overcome the enemy in both open-solution strategy sections,
as well as more streamlined, one-solution puzzle sections.
