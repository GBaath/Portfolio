## *Description*

This page contains some fo the work I contributed with in the making of Wheelin' and Stealin'; a 7 week VR gameproject made by a team of 8. 
The gameplay consists of exploring dungeon, and shotting enemies, while controlling a wheelchair.

## **Wheelchair controls**

Luckily, really early on in the projects lifespan, I managed to find an existing wheelchair controller made by [**justinmajetich**](https://github.com/justinmajetich/vr-wheelchair) which I could easily get started with,
most of the tweaks I made physics values, rotation locking, and collider smoothing. Needless to say, it took alot of *n*a*u*s*e*a trying to balance all the numbers.
