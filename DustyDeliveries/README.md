## *Game description*

**Dusty Deliveries** is a CO-OP adventure game where you together walk around on a ship. Set the course and engage the thrusters and explore the desert landscape!

## My Contrbutions

*This project was made entirely using blueprints for Unrealscript examples check out a [newer repo](https://github.com/GBaath/Portfolio/tree/main/UnrealProductConfigurator#unreal-product-configurator)*

----

# *Dual Player Controller*

*Note: The project is made in Unreal 5.1 and this version has a bugged controller list, preventing the use of local co-op with both mouse and keyboard. Thus, this controller is approximately twice as big as it could have been, were it made in a later engine version*

# *Ship Control Modules*
These are the interactable stations that control the movement of the ship, mostly controlling external variables of the ship's physics controller (not made by me).
They interact with the player controllers using an interface, along with getting possesed by the interacting player pawn, overwriting the regular movement input.
